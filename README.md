# Project-1
DecaySimulator.py simulates radioactive decay using python standard library's poisson distribution, plots it and outputs two textfiles with two distributions.

DecayAnalysis_Likelihood.py calculates the likelihood curves, critical lambda value and Beta values and plots it.

DecayAnalysis_LLR.py calculates and plots the Log-Likelihood ratio.

Alpha and the two lambdas can be specied in each of the script. DecayAnalysis scripts have to be in the same folder as the output to work, if not the path to the output can be specified in the script itself.
